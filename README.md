#Are You Good Enough?

###Objective: 
You are young, single, and ready to mingle, but are you good enough to win a date with Miss B? Try your luck at this 15 question quiz!

###Technologies:
>HTML

>CSS

>JavaSript/jQuery

###Design:

What a blast from past!

To achieve this cheesy-70's-gameshow vibe, I've added a corny trivia background and accompanied that with a gameshow jingle and your typical applause and boo track.

###Getting started:
1. Click [here](http://Parekeet.github.io/dating_trivia_game/)
3. Press 'Start'

###How To Play:

You have 60 seconds to answer 15 questions correctly.
If you answer one incorrectly, you will have to restart the game.
Miss B deserves nothing _less_ than perfect.

###Next Steps:
1. Add more animation to the entire game.
2. Create a status bar so players know which question they're on.
3. Create a better picture of Miss B.
